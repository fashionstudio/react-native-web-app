# Contributing to React Native Web App
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## First-time contributors
We've tagged some issues to make it easy to get started :)
[Good first issues](https://github.com/fashionstudio/react-native-web-app/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

Add a comment on the issue and wait for the issue to be assigned before you start working on it. This helps to avoid multiple people working on similar issues.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Git-Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. Please create the branch in the format feature/<issue-id>-<issue-name> (eg: feature/176-chart-widget)
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache-2.0 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache-2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
