# App Structure

## Introduction

Instead of repeating over and over the same process of creating an app using a web view, this library does everything for you. Only import it and pass in options.

This is made for Fashion Studio's apps.

It supports:
- [ ] Tracking Transparency
- [ ] Custom Events (like user authentication)
- [x] Apple Pay
- [x] Push Notifications
- [x] Offline mode
- [x] Custom font
- [x] Loading screen
- [x] Typings

## Code Samples

> You've gotten their attention in the introduction, now show a few code examples. So they get a visualization and as a bonus, make them copy/paste friendly.

## Installation

This library being private, you can't download it from `npm`'s servers.

```
yarn add "git+https://<personal-token>:x-oauth-basic@github.com/fashionstudio/app-structure.git"
```
or
```
npm i "git+https://<personal-token>:x-oauth-basic@github.com/fashionstudio/app-structure.git"
```

To get the `<personal-token>`, follow those instructions: [creating a personal token][1].
