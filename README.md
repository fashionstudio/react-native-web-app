# App Structure

## Introduction

Instead of repeating over and over the same process of creating an app using a web view, this library does everything for you. Only import it and pass in options.

This is made for Fashion Studio app.

It supports:
- Push Notifications
- Tracking Transparency
- Offline mode
- Custom font
- Loading screen
- Apple Pay

## Code Samples

> You've gotten their attention in the introduction, now show a few code examples. So they get a visualization and as a bonus, make them copy/paste friendly.

## Installation

> The installation instructions are low priority in the readme and should come at the bottom. The first part answers all their objections and now that they want to use it, show them how.
