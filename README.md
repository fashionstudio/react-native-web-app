# App Structure

## Introduction

Instead of repeating over and over the same process of creating an app using a web view, this library does everything for you. Only import it and pass in options.

This is made for Fashion Studio's apps.

It supports:
- Push Notifications
- Tracking Transparency
- Offline mode
- Custom font
- Loading screen
- Apple Pay

## Code Samples

> You've gotten their attention in the introduction, now show a few code examples. So they get a visualization and as a bonus, make them copy/paste friendly.

## Installation

This library being private, you can't download it from `npm`.

`yarn add git+ssh://git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git`
